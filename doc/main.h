 * \section intro-sec Introduction
 * <a href="https://sns3.org/">sns-3</a> documentation is maintained using
 * <a href="https://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a>.
 * Doxygen is typically used for
 * API documentation, and organizes such documentation across different
 * modules. This project uses Doxygen for building the definitive
 * maintained API documentation.
 *
 * This project is built on top of <a href="https://www.nsnam.org/">ns-3</a>
 * and, as such, the full documentation is maintained at the
 * <a href="https://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.39/doxygen/index.html">ns-3 project web site</a>.
 *
 * \section module-sec Module overview
 *
 * The ns-3 library is split across many modules organized under the
 * <b><a href="https://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.39/doxygen/modules.html">Modules</a></b> tab.
 *
 * This project adds a new module, named satellite, to the ns-3 ecosystem. This documentation
 * is for this module only.
 * Missing entries from this documentation should be searched in the ns-3 documentation for
 * further information.
